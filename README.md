Hello, 
So, I figured the best work flow would be with github connecting to the Android studio IDE. 

To set up github with Android studio, do steps 1 and 2 on the below link:
https://medium.com/code-yoga/how-to-link-android-studio-with-github-312037a13b99

This will link your android studio to your github account. From there, you'll want
to access this repo on android studio via github. To do so, follow the steps below:
    file -> new -> project from version control 
    Version control: Git
    URL: https://github.com/dylanRidener/LocalApparel
    Directory: ***your preferred saving path***
    
  (Note that this process may vary depending on OS)
  

I'm still reading up on on the detail on how pushing and pulling from origin will 
work between us all but this should be the starting point.
